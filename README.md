The Pokemon App is build with React JS and vanilla CSS. Data from Poke API is fetched with Axios to make HTTP requests easier. List of all pokemons is rendered on the left side with pagination of 20 items per page. Above it the user can select desired Generation and filter the search results accordingly. By selecting one of the pokemons a pokemon card is displayed on the right side with an image, name and all the attributes. By clicking on the Compare button, a second card is displayed on the right side and the user can easily compare the stats of different pokemons with the first one selected. Save Me button is also provided that saves the cards in Local Storage, so the user can save favourite pokemon and can easily find them under My Pokemons next time they visit the application. Additionally by clicking on a saved pokemon all the stats are displayed in the card above.
