<h2> About this App </h2>

The Pokemon App is build with React JS and vanilla CSS. External data from Poke API is fetched with Axios to make HTTP requests easier. List of all pokemons is rendered on the left side with pagination of 20 items per page. Above it the user can select desired Generation and filter the search results accordingly. By selecting one of the pokemons a pokemon card is displayed on the right side with an image, name and all the attributes. By clicking on the Compare button, a second card is displayed on the right side and the user can easily compare the stats of different pokemons with the first one selected. Save Me button is also provided that saves the cards in Local Storage, so the user can save favourite pokemon and can easily find them under My Pokemons next time they visit the application. Additionally by clicking on a saved pokemon all the stats are displayed in the card above.

<h2> Callenges </h2>
One of the callenges I had working on this app was that it took me a long time to figure out the type of API and data I was working with. In order to overcome this I had to step back and learn a bit more about Pokemons in general which then helped me working with the data structures and end points of the API.

<h2>If I had more time </h2>
If I had more time I would implement a search bar for the user to easily find desired pokemon. I would also research more about the different Pokemon games and add features related to them.
